My own experiment of implementing Haskell-like parsers in C++

## How to build and run

You can just run `make` but providing dependencies is on you.
I recommend to use [Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html#nix-quick-install) so
that all the dependencies will be provided for you automatically and with exact
same version I used when developing this stuff.

### Using Nix

``` sh
nix-shell --run cpp-parsing
```

Or build and run it separately:

``` sh
nix build
result/bin/cpp-parsing
```

#### Development shell

If youâ€™re going to manually (re-)build the app using `make` or/and `g++`
directly you can omit building the app when entering a nix-shell by setting the
`build-the-program` argument to `false` like this:

``` sh
nix-shell --arg build-the-program false
```
